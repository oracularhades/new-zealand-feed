# new-zealand-feed

# Why?
There are already Aotearoa New Zealand feeds on Bluesky, however, I think they could be tailored significantly better. A lot of it is random news articles and overseas mentions of us, instead of what's actually happening in Aotearoa New Zealand.

# Reporting
Please report anyone breaking New Zealand law or Bluesky ToS to Bluesky.

# What's included
- Posters must be part of the Kiwi list. This is to avoid bots and spam. Both NZers overseas and at home are welcome. To be added to this feed, @oracularhades.com with your best "sweet as" in text form, or point to Aotearoa/New Zealand on a map: https://bsky.app/profile/oracularhades.com/lists/3ktdaeavtdc2a

Putting a # in-front of most of these also works: Aotearoa, New Zealand, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton, Tauranga, Dunedin, Palmerston North, Palmerston South, Napier, Nelson, Rotorua, New Plymouth, Whangarei, Invercargill, Whanganui, Hastings, Gisborne, Upper Hutt, Lower Hutt, Blenheim, Timaru, Paraparaumu, Masterton, Queenstown, Wanganui, Greymouth, Tokoroa, Oamaru, Ashburton, Levin, Whakatane, Feilding, Cambridge, Kerikeri, Thames, Pukekohe, Waitakere, Porirua, Manukau, Rangiora, Wanaka, Motueka, Taupo, Gore, Temuka, Westport, Kaikoura, Martinborough, Arrowtown, Mosgiel, Balclutha, Kaikohe, Te Anau, Kerikeri, Hanmer Springs, Tuatapere.

# What's filtered:
- News articles are allowed, however, this isn't #nzpol, and we're keeping the vibes ✨immaculate✨. I'm trying to keep this feed about how cool New Zealanders and Kiwis are. We're a democracy, and discource is absolutely vital, but please do not constantly post news. Important issues such as (but not limited to) trans rights, LGBTQ+ rights, New Zealand technology law, relevant fact checks to relevant common myths, etc, are **absolutely** welcome. But it's important this feed does not turn into 1 person spamming the same 1 sided news articles. **As a rule of thumb: 1 news article every 3 days, not counting replies intending to update people on a situation, such as "UPDATE: They fixed it! https://example.com/this-issue-was-fixed-by-govt" or "24 hours later, kiwis still without power", so long as they are replies to your original article post.**
